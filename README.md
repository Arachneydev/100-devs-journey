# 100-devs-journey
This will be my accountability log as I pursue my dreams of breaking into the tech industry with 100 devs. 
This will be my space to show my growth and let my inner baddie out. 
I found the 100devs community last August 07, 2022 but it wasn't until October 7, 2022 that I really decided to take things seriously. 
As of the moment of writing, I have just finished class 10 of the second cohort and I will soon start learning javascript. I will begin with the class 10 layouts that I'm currently doing then post the previous ones during my free time.


To those from the community who are reading this and suffering from imposter syndrome, 
let it be known that I started with zero, zilch, nada coding knowledge. 
Let's all remember the quote from Coach Carter: 

Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate, our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure.
It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. 

Your playing small does not serve the world. 
There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. 

We are all meant to shine as children do. 
And, as we let our own light shine, we consciously give other people permission to do the same. 

As we are liberated from our fear, our prescence automatically liberates others.

If I can start with nothing and get somewhere then you can too! Keep going cause we promised to carry the boats and the logs.

Next, thank you to Leon and his team for this amazing opportunity 
for taking the time to teach a bunch of people you've never seen, and even heard of haha. 
Your passion and advocacy for teaching is what lead us here, 
and to the people in the community who never tire of answering our questions thank you as well.
